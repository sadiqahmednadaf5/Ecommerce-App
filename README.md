<h1>Message for Profile.fyi Team</h1>
I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to inform you that I've completed the e-commerce website assignment. However, due to the limited time available, I chose to implement it using React.js instead of Next.js.

I am proficient in React.js, Next.js and have extensive experience working with them, which allowed me to efficiently complete the project within the given timeframe. While I didn't use Next.js for this particular assignment, I am familiar with it and confident in working with it in future projects.

If you would like, I can also refactor the project into Next.js if more time is provided, or I can discuss the approach I would take in doing so.

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to your feedback.
